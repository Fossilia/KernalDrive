A quick local media organizer for your movies that works offline. View your movies from any storage device in a clean, easy to use interface.

When viewing media files on your Windows PC, file explorer provide little interaction for the users, especially for users who have lots of media downloaded. To solve this issue, we have developed a local movie organizer/viewer desktop application which will, scan a given directory for all its movie files, organize these movies in a graphical interface with additional functionality.
